==========================================
 AK4951 Controller (Digital ALC) for HL2+
==========================================

 Usage
 -----

  Set your HL2+ IP address to text box and then click "SET" botton.
  Note: If IP address is changed after clicked "SET" botton, AK4951 Controller should be restarted.


  Case 1: Rx audio limitter
  -------------------------
    1. Select "RX" button on Digital ALC panel.
    2. Set "REF LEVEL" to 0.
    3. Adjust volume slider on Thetis to your desired volume.
    4. Increase "REF LEVEL" to the point where the volume you monitor begins to drop.

       The above settings will help avoid excessively loud receiver audio.


  Case 2: Mic audio limitter with gain
  ------------------------------------
    1. Select "TX" button on Digital ALC panel.
    2. At first, set "REF LEVEL" (reference level) to 0. 
    3. Press "default" button to set Mic AMP analog gain to 18dB.

    4. Check both loopback and link-DAC-ATT checkbox.
       Speakers will automatically turn off to prevent unnecessary feedback (howling).

    5. While speaking into a microphone at normal volume, increase "REF LEVEL" 
       to the point where the volume you monitor in your headphones begins to drop.
       The above settings allow for proper gain settings that avoid saturation.

    6. In addition, if REF LEVEL is big value, increase Mic AMP gain and then repeat step 5.
       Amplifying with Mic AMP analog gain may result in better sound quality than amplifying
       with high REF LEVEL digitally.

    7. If necessary, uncheck link-DAC-ATT checkbox to check the audio that is sent to Thetis.
    8. At last, uncheck loopback checkbox.
